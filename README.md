<h1> Vacation Planner! </h1>

<h2> A vacation planning web application to allow a user to construct a list of destinations by city and country and allows user to make if they had visited yet.</h2>

<p>
This full stack app was built using the following development methods:
  <ol>
    <li>Javascript</li>

  </ol>

  <br>
I started with creating the back end first utilizing rails. from there I needed to contruct authorization to crate an account, log in and sign out. After that was completed I then moved on to building the CRUD functions ragarding the destinations people wish to travel to. I did not get to do as much styling yet

 User Stories:
  <ol>
    <li>The User can create a new account.</li>
    <li>The User can sign in and change password if they choose to do so.</li>
    <li>The User can see their vacation destinations chosen.</li>
    <li>The User can create new destinations to travel to.</li>
    <li>The User can update their vacations and see the changes in real time.</li>
    <li>The User can delete a vacation if they choose to do so.</li>
    <li>The User can sign out.</li>
    <li>The User can't see any other user vacation but their own.</li>
  </ol>
